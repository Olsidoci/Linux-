# 🐧 Linux File Permissions & Authorization

## 📄 Project Description

This project simulates a real-world scenario in which I serve as a security professional managing file permissions for a research team in a large organization. My responsibility is to ensure that file access permissions across a Linux-based system align with the organization’s security policies. Through this project, I demonstrate my ability to investigate existing file permissions, interpret permission strings, identify misconfigurations, and apply appropriate changes using Linux command-line tools.

The goal is to enhance system security by restricting unauthorized access and ensuring sensitive data is protected based on user roles.
